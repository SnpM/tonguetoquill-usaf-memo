The following information on writing a memorandum comes from the AFH 33-337 Tongue and Quill, pages 183-186. This template matches the format for the header on page 183, and the body on page 185. The letterhead is in Arial with the "DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE" bolded, and the unit name un-bolded. Addresses in the "MEMORANDUM FOR" and "FROM" are only if the letter for an off station addressee and are not requiredâ€”however, office symbols are!

When writing the body start with number 1 directly under the S in subject. If there is only one paragraph do not enter the number of paragraph. Also, if it is more than one line it must line up under the number one, like it is here.

#sub-par[Sub-points will be lowercase letter]

#sub-sub-par[Sub-Sub-points will be parenthesis with numbers]

#sub-sub-sub-par[Sub-sub-sub points are getting ridiculous, but it is parenthesis with lower case letters]

#sub-sub-sub-sub-par[Sub-sub-sub-sub (say that ten times fast) uses brackets, and the next level will be with letters instead of numbers.]

Double space between each paragraph. After each number put two spaces between the number the first word of your paragraph.

The signature block must be 5 line below the last paragraph, which should leave four empty line between the last paragraph and the first line of the signature block. The block should also start at 2 spaces past the middle point of the letter (basically 3 3/8" on a word document with 1 inch borders. If the letter is electronically signed it must be in this format "//signed/jsd/14May2008//" and must be part of a electronically signed email. You must keep the email of the signed letter. This is a bit confusing, but the process makes it a lot easier for us. I will help you with this if you do not understand.

If you end the letter with "any questions please contact" do not create a new paragraph just for that information. Put it at the end of the last paragraph on the topic. Like this paragraph. If you have any questions please contact MSgt Joe Doe at 632-8620.
