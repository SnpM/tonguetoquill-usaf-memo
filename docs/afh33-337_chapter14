# The Official Memorandum

This chapter covers:

- The Heading Section
- The Text of the Official Memorandum
- The Closing Section
- Additional Information
- Attachments
- The Official Memorandum: Examples
- Spelling Checkers: Before You Sign

Memorandums are used to communicate throughout the DoD and with other Federal agencies as
well as to conduct official business outside the Government with vendors or contractors when a
personal letter is inappropriate. Official memorandums may be addressed to specific officials,
single offices, multiple offices, multiple offices IN TURN or to DISTRIBUTION lists. Follow
the guidance of this chapter when preparing any official memorandum, beginning with these
basic format requirements:

1. Use printed letterhead, computer-generated letterhead, or plain bond paper.
2. Type or print using black ink.
3. Follow AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, applicable executive
    orders and DoD guidance for the necessary markings on classified correspondence.
4. Use 1-inch margins on the left, right and bottom for most memorandums. For shorter
    communications, you may adjust the margins.
    a. 20 lines or more  1 inch margins
    b. 10-19 lines  1 to 1 1/2 inch margins
    c. 1- 9 lines  1 1/2 to 2 inch margins

AFH 33-337, 27 MAY 2015

5. Use 12 point Times New Roman font for text. Smaller sizes, no smaller than 10 point,
    may be used when required to control page breaks. For example, shrink the font of all
    text in the memorandum to prevent a page break between the body and closing elements
    (signature block). The signature block is never on a page by itself.

For most documents, the guidance for the specific elements on the following pages needs no
adjustments; however, for short communications, you may adjust the top margin in order to
balance the content toward the vertical center of the document by moving all elements from the
date to the last line of the closing to achieve visual balance and avoid a top-heavy appearance.

## The Heading Section

The heading section is composed of these elements: date, MEMORANDUM FOR,
ATTENTION, FROM, SUBJECT and References. Each element is described in detail, below.

Date

Placement and Format: Place the date 1 inch from the right edge, 1.75 inches from the top
of the page. Use the “Day Month Year” or “DD Mmm YY” format for documents addressed to
a military organization. In the “DD Mmm YY” format, the month and year are both abbreviated
for consistency. For civilian addressees, use the “Month Day, Year” format. Finally, unless the
date of signature has legal significance, date the original and all copies of the correspondence at
the time of dispatch.

Examples:

Military Addressees–Day Month Year 15 October 2014

Military Addressees–DD Mmm YY 15 Oct 14

Civilian Addressees–Month Day, Year October 15, 2014

### “MEMORANDUM FOR”

Placement: Place “MEMORANDUM FOR” on the second line below the date. Leave two
spaces between “MEMORANDUM FOR” and the recipient’s organization abbreviation
and office symbol (ORG/SYMBOL). If there are multiple recipients, two or three office
symbols may be placed on each line with the second and following lines aligned under the first
recipient. If there are numerous recipients, use the “ DISTRIBUTION” element.

- When addressing one office, enter the organization/office symbol in uppercase letters.
    To indicate the memorandum is for a specific person, enter the organization/office
    symbol followed by the person’s rank and name in parentheses—all in uppercase.
    Another option is to use the “ATTENTION” element—see guidance below.
- When addressing several offices, a lign subsequent addressees under the first address. If
    the office symbols are fairly short and you have several for the memorandum, you may
    include two or three on a single line by aligning each additional line of recipients under
    the recipients in the first line in like fashion. Be consistent with your format: write out
    all organization names or use all organization/office symbols.


```
CHAPTER 14
The Official Memorandum
```
- When addressing several offices IN TURN, use the “IN TURN” format to distribute the
    official memorandum to several individuals or offices in sequence. The only difference
    is the format of the “MEMORANDUM FOR” element, as shown below.
    o “IN TURN” Originators: Prepare an “IN TURN” memorandum when the final
       addressee or OPR must see the coordination or action of all addressees. Use the
       official memorandum format. Type “IN TURN” in uppercase, one line below the last
       address of the “MEMORANDUM FOR” element aligned with the addresses.
    o “IN TURN” Recipients: When you receive an “IN TURN” memorandum, strike
       through your organization abbreviation and office symbol, then type, sign or initial,
       and date. Type “Concur,” “ Nonconcur,” “Comments attached” or “Comments sent
       by separate correspondence to” next to the date. Prepare a separate memorandum for
       a lengthy comment. Attach comments to the “IN TURN” memorandum if the
       remaining addressees need them; otherwise, forward comments directly to the final
       addressee. Forward the “IN TURN” memorandum to the next address and “cc” the
       OPR for tracking purposes.
- Using a distribution element or list. When the address list is too long to include in the
    “MEMORANDUM FOR” element, use the distribution element or list. Simply leave two
    spaces after “MEMORANDUM FOR” and add “DISTRIBUTION” in uppercase letters.
    Include the addressees in the “DISTRIBUTION” element or on a separate page attached
    to the memorandum.

Headquarters or HQ: The term headquarters and “HQ” are a part of the official title of units at
the group-level and above. Use HQ as part of the organization abbreviation and office symbol
when corresponding with staff elements at MAJCOM and HQ United States Air Force
organizations. Do not use the term headquarters or HQ when corresponding with the office of
MAJCOM commanders and vice commanders.

Examples:

MEMORANDUM FOR 79 FS/DO (LT COL JORGE TORRES)

MEMORANDUM FOR CHIEF OF STAFF
DIRECTOR, INSTALLATIONS AND LOGISTICS
GENERAL COUNSEL

MEMORANDUM FOR 42 ABW/JA 42 ABW/SE 42 ABW/XP
[SECOND LINE] [SECOND LINE] [SECOND LINE]
[THIRD LINE] [THIRD LINE] [THIRD LINE]

MEMORANDUM FOR AF/A4 [Use “AF” for Air Staff elements of HQ USAF;
AF/A3 use “SAF” for Secretary of the Air Force staff
AF/A1 elements of HQ USAF.]
IN TURN

MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION


The Tongue and Quill
AFH 33-337, 27 MAY 2015

“ATTENTION:”

Placement: The attention element is aligned under the address or office symbol in the
“MEMORANDUM FOR” line. The attention element is used when a memorandum is intended
for both an office and the attention of a specific person in that office. The format of the attention
element is to place “ATTENTION:” or “ATTN:” or “THROUGH:” with the abbreviated rank
and last name in uppercase on the line immediately below the “MEMORANDUM FOR” line.

Example:

MEMORANDUM FOR 36 FS/DO
ATTENTION: MAJ JONES

### “FROM:”

Placement: Place “FROM:” in uppercase, flush with the left margin, on the second line below
the last line of the MEMORANDUM FOR element (or the ATTENTION element, if used).
After the “FROM:” element, leave two spaces followed by the organization abbreviation and
office symbol (ORG/SYMBOL) of the originator.

Contents: If the complete mailing address is printed on the letterhead or if all recipients are
located on the same installation as the originator, then only a single line FROM element
consisting of the organization abbreviation and office symbol is used.

If the complete mailing address is not printed on the letterhead or if the recipients are on another
installation, then the FROM element contains the full mailing address of the originator. This
enables recipients to easily prepare and address return correspondence.

- The first line of the FROM element includes the organization abbreviation and office
    symbol separated by a virgule and typed in uppercase.
- The second line of the FROM element is the delivery address of the originator in upper
    and lower case.
- The third line of the FROM element includes the city, state and ZIP+4 code (without a
    comma between the city and state). For some installations, the city or installation name
    may be used interchangeably, as shown in the examples, below. Consult your local
    United States Post Office for details. The standard format for spacing between the state
    abbreviation and the ZIP code is two spaces.

Examples:

FROM: 20 FW/CC [Sender and receiver on same installation]

FROM: HQ SOC/CC [Sender and receiver on different installations]
125 Chennault Circle
Montgomery AL 36112- 6430 [City State option]

FROM: HQ SOC/CC [Sender and receiver on different installations]
125 Chennault Circle
Maxwell AFB AL 36112- 6430 [Installation State option]


```
CHAPTER 14
The Official Memorandum
```
“SUBJECT:”

Placement: In all uppercase letters place “SUBJECT:”, flush with the left margin, on the
second line below the last line of the FROM element. After “SUBJECT:”, type two spaces
followed by the title; capitalize the first letter of each word except articles, prepositions and
conjunctions. Be brief and clear to focus readers; if you need a second line, align it under the
first word of the subject.

- When writing about an individual/employee who is not the addressee, include rank/grade
    and full name in the subject line. If you refer to the person again in the text of the
    memorandum, use only the rank/grade and surname.
- Do not include names in the subject line when writing about two or more individuals.
- When writing about several people, state their full names with rank/grade in the text of
    the memorandum the first time the names appear.
- SUSPENSE items: Include the suspense date in the subject line by typing “SUSPENSE:”
    or “SUSP:” with the date in parentheses after the title. If additional information for the
    suspense is necessary, include it in a separate paragraph—not in the SUBJECT line.

Examples:

SUBJECT: Official Memorandum Format Standards

SUBJECT: Letter of Appreciation (SSgt Angela Harkins)

SUBJECT: Self-Inspection Checklist Completion (SUSPENSE: 23 September 2014)

SUBJECT: The Format for a Subject Line That is Too Long for a Single Line Must Wrap and
be Aligned Under the First Word of the Subject in the Subject Line

“References”

Placement: There are two options for placement of the references element—within the subject
line or below the subject line. Cite a single reference to a communication or a directive in
parentheses immediately after the subject title. For two or more references, type “References:”
on the second line below the last line of the SUBJECT element. Capitalize the first letter of
every word except articles, prepositions and conjunctions.

Citation Format: In general, identify references within the DoD by organization, type of
communication, date and title. The organization and type of document within the DoD are
included in the document’s identification (e.g., an AFMAN is an Air Force Manual; a DoDD is a
DoD Directive) and need not be written out in the “References” section. For referencing
commercial publications, use the notes entry format from AU-1 Style and Author Guide or use
The Chicago Manual of Style (AU-1 is based on The Chicago Manual of Style). AU-1 is
available online from the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). In general, the notes
entries include the author’s name, publication title, publisher, date, and the paragraph or page
number.

Additional Information for References: When completing the reference list, consider the
questions the recipients might have based on the memorandum you sent to them. For example, if
it can be assumed that the recipient is unfamiliar with the publication or form cited, write out the
title the first time you reference it. Also, you may want to attach a copy of the reference, or
instructions on how to obtain it, if the reader does not have it. Finally, if the reference was not
sent to all addressees previously, type not to all “(NOTAL)” after the citation for the referenced

CHAPTER 14
The Official Memorandum
```
## The Text of the Official Memorandum

Begin the text of the memorandum on the second line below the subject or references (if used).

1. Spacing paragraphs and subparagraphs. Single-space the text, but double-space
    between paragraphs and subparagraphs (one blank line between all paragraphs and
    subparagraphs). You may double-space the text of a one-paragraph memorandum less
    than eight lines.
2. Numbering paragraphs. Number and letter each paragraph and subparagraph. A single
    paragraph is not numbered. If your organization is a part of Headquarters Air Force (the
    Air Staff and the Secretariat), follow the guidance in HQ Operating Instruction 33-3,
    Correspondence Preparation, Control, and Tracking.
3. Formatting short subparagraphs. Use a run-in method of listing subparagraphs when
    the subparagraphs consist of short sentences or phrases. The run-in method has several
    advantages: (a) it’s compact, (b) it highlights ideas, and (c) it saves space.
4. First Line of Text. The first paragraph is never indented; it is numbered and flush left,
    two line spaces below the last line of the SUBJECT element (or the References element,
    if used). Indent the first line of sub-paragraphs to align the number or letter with the first
    character of its parent level paragraph. Each sub-level is likewise indented to align its
    paragraph number or letter with the first character of its parent level paragraph.
5. Subsequent lines of text. All second and subsequent lines of text for all paragraphs at
    all levels begin flush with the left margin; do not indent.
6. Punctuation. Use conventional rules of English grammar for punctuation in the body.
7. Word Division. When dividing a word, separate between syllables.
8. Quotations. When quoting numbered paragraphs from another document, cite the source
    and paragraph numbers in your text.
9. Suspense Dates. If you include a Suspense date in the text of the memorandum and not
    in the Subject Element, emphasize it by placing it in a separate paragraph.
10. Contact information. Place contact names, e-mail addresses, fax numbers, and
    telephone numbers in the last paragraph of the memorandum text.
11. Continuation Pages. Use plain bond paper. Begin typing the text of the continuation
    page four lines below the page number. Type at least two lines of the text on each page.
    Avoid dividing a paragraph of less than four lines between two pages.
12. Page numbering. The first page of a memorandum is never numbered. You may omit
    page numbers on a one- or two-page memorandum; however, memorandums longer than
    two pages must have page numbers. Number the succeeding pages starting with page 2.
    Place page numbers 0.5-inch from the top of the page, flush with the right margin.
    Number the continuation pages of each attachment as a separate sequence.

## The Closing Section

The closing section of the document includes these elements: authority line, signature block,
signature, attachments, courtesy copy and distribution.


The Tongue and Quill
AFH 33-337, 27 MAY 2015

Authority Line

Placement and Use: The authority line informs readers that the person who signed the
document acted for the commander, the command section, or the headquarters. If an authority
line is used, add “FOR THE COMMANDER” (or appropriate title) in uppercase on the second
line below the last line of the text and 4.5 inches from the left edge of the page or three spaces to
the right of the page center.

Use the authority line
when any of these are true:

```
Do not use the authority line
in any of these conditions:
```
1. A commander’s designated
    representative signs for a specific
    action.
2. A document represents the
    commander’s position or the
    coordinated position of the
    headquarters staff.
3. Staff members sign documents that
    direct action or announce policy
    within their areas of responsibility.
       1. The commander (or head of the organization)
          signs.
       2. The deputy or vice commander signs when the
          commander is temporarily away from the place of
          duty unless command action is directed by law
          and requires an indication of delegation.
       3. The correspondence expresses opinions of units,
          directorates, divisions, offices, or branches.
       4. The correspondence is addressed outside the DoD.

Signature Block

Placement: Start the signature block on the fifth line below the last line of text and 4.5 inches
from the left edge of the page or three spaces to the right of page center. If the authority line is
used, type the signature element five lines below the authority line. If dual signatures are
required, type the junior ranking official’s signature block at the left margin; type the senior
ranking official’s signature block 4.5 inches from the left edge of the page or three spaces to the
right of page center. Do not place the signature element on a continuation page by itself.
Consider correspondence received via e-mail, copied, or stamped //SIGNED// as authoritative as
long as the signed copy is kept on file at the originating office.

1. First Line. Type the name in uppercase the way the person signs it (normally as it
    appears in the member’s official records). Include grade and service for military
    members or grade and “DAF” (Department of the Air Force) for civilians. In general,
    avoid using legal, educational, or ecclesiastical degrees or titles. As a rule, the rank for
    colonels and general officers should not be abbreviated.
2. Second Line. Type the duty title as identified in the “FROM” element. “ Acting” may be
    added before the duty title of a staff position if the incumbent is absent or the position is
    vacant. In addition, do not sign “for” or “in the absence of.” Do not use “Acting” for any
    command capacity or where prohibited by law or statute (see AFI 33-321, Authentication
    of Air Force Records; and AFI 51-604, Appointment to and Assumption of Command).
3. Third Line. Type the name of the office or organization level if it is not included on the
    letterhead or the heading. Limit the signature element to three lines if possible; however,
    if a line of the signature element is too long, indent the next line to begin under the third
    character of the line above.

Signature

Placement: Sign correspondence with permanent black ink. Use black typewriter ribbons,
black printer toner, or black ink for rubber stamps or signature facsimile equipment. See AFI 33-
321, Authentication of Air Force Records, for authentication of Air Force documents and how to
use seals instead of signatures.

Attachment or Attachments

Placement: Place “Attachment:” (for a single attachment) or “# Attachments:” (for two or more
attachments) at the left margin, on the third line below the signature element. When there are
two or more attachments, list each by number and in the order mentioned in the memorandum.


The Tongue and Quill
AFH 33-337, 27 MAY 2015

Beneath “Attachment” briefly describe each attachment, but do not use general terms or
abbreviations such as “as stated,” “ as described above,” or “a/s.” Cite the office of origin, type
of communication, date, and number of copies (in parentheses) if more than one. Include the
subject of the attachment if the receiver will not get copies of attachments or if the subject is not
already referenced in text. For classified attachments, show the assigned classification symbol in
parentheses. Send a copy of the memorandum when you send the attachment (first example,
below). If sending an attachment separately, type “(sep cover)” after the attachment label (see
example, below). Do not divide attachment listings between two pages. If the listing is too long,
type “Attachments: (listed on next page),” and list the attachments on a separate page.

Examples:

Attachment: [Memorandum with a single attachment]
ACC/CC Leave Policy Memo, 30 Jun 14

3 Attachments: [Memorandum with 2 or more attachments]

1. SAF CIO/A6 Memo, 30 Jun 12 (U)(2)
2. 380 FMS/CC Msg, 232300Z May 12 (NOTAL)
3. SAF/CIO Memo, 3 Aug 12 (S)

2 Attachments: [Memorandum with attachments under separate cover]

1. AFI XX-XXXX, 26 Sep 12
2. AFI XX-XXXX, 1 4 May 12 (sep cover)

12 Attachments (listed on next page) [Memorandum with attachments listed on next page]

Courtesy Copy Element (“cc:”)

Placement: When sending courtesy copies to activities other than to addressee, place “cc:” flush
with the left margin, on the second line below the attachment element. If the attachment
element is not used, place “cc:” on the third line below the signature element. List the
organization abbreviation and office symbol of the offices to receive copies. When the copy is
intended for a specific person in the office, include the person’s Rank and Name in parentheses
after the office symbol. If a courtesy copy is sent without including the attachments, type
“wo/Atch” after the office. For paper copies, circle, underline, or highlight the office to indicate
the recipient.

Examples:

cc: [Courtesy copies with attachment variations]
HQ AETC/A1 wo/Atch
HQ USAFE/A1 Atch 2 only
HQ PACAF/A1 (Atch under sep cover)
cc: [Courtesy copy to an office]
1 FW/CCP

cc: [Courtesy copy to a specific individual in an office]
12 FS/DO (Capt Thomas Moore)

If courtesy copies of a memorandum are not signed, write or stamp “signed” with black or dark
blue ink above the signature block. Also, do not show internal distribution of courtesy copies on
the original (or courtesy copy) for correspondence addressed outside your activity. However,


```
CHAPTER 14
The Official Memorandum
```
you may show the distribution if one addressee needs to know who received a courtesy copy, or
if correspondence is multiple-addressed and reproduced.

Distribution Element

Placement: If “MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION” is used, place “DISTRIBUTION:”
flush with the left margin, on the second line below the attachment element or the courtesy copy
element, if used. If neither the attachment element nor the courtesy copy elements are used,
place “DISTRIBUTION” on the third line below the signature element. Do not divide
distribution lists between two pages. If the list is too long, type “DISTRIBUTION (listed on
next page),” and list the organizations on a separate page.

## Additional Information

The automated file designator element is optional and it is frequently beneficial to show if a
document is a record or coordination copy. If there are several documents in a package, they
should be arranged for action and clarity. See below for further details on these items.

Optional Automated File Designator (AFD) Element

The AFD element documents the storage location for data stored electronically. Type the AFD
two line spaces below the courtesy copy distribution element. You may include the AFD in the
identification line of talking, position, and bullet background papers. Contents of the AFD are
based on the user’s needs and the system being used. For example, the element may include the
file name, typist’s initials, and the uniform resource locator (URL) if stored on a website.

Typeset Correspondence

You may typeset correspondence for a large audience (such as a memorandum to ALMAJCOM-
FOA). Use an appropriate letterhead as with other official correspondence. You can use the full
range of typesetting capabilities, including, but not limited to, two columns, italics, bold type,
variable spacing, boxed inserts, and screened backgrounds.

Record or Coordination Copy

This is the official record for your office files, so make sure it is fully legible. Type or write
additional information of value only to the office of record on the record or coordination copy.

- Showing Coordination. Type or write the organization abbreviation and office symbol
    of each office that should coordinate across the bottom or right side of the record copy.
    The coordinating officials enter their last name and date.
- Showing Internal Courtesy Copy Distribution. List all internal courtesy distribution
    on the record copy unless it is listed on the original.
- Identifying the Writer. If identifying the writer is of value to the office of record, place
    the writer’s organization abbreviation and office symbol, name, telephone number,
    typist’s initials, the date the correspondence is typed, and, if desired, the document
    name/number at the top or bottom margin of the page. Do not repeat the writer’s name if
    the writer signed the correspondence. Use a new identification line, if desired, each time


The Tongue and Quill
AFH 33-337, 27 MAY 2015

```
the correspondence is rewritten or retyped. Place the name of the person who rewrote it
on the next line followed by the date it was retyped.
```
- Annotating for Magnetic Storage Media. Use the writer identification line to show
    document name, storage location, or file identification for reference and possible revision
    or reprinting.
- Preparing a Memorandum for Record (MR). When preparing a MR, whether it is for
    another office or when using it as your primary record, write or type on the record copy
    any information needed for the record. Continue on the back or a separate sheet if you
    need more space. The writer then signs the MR. (“MR” is the technical abbreviation for
    a memorandum for record; however, “MFR” is more widely recognized by Airmen.)

## Attachments

Many times you will need to attach supporting documents to your correspondence and the order
of these documents has meaning for your correspondence. Placing supporting documents in the
right order conveys levels of significance and relationships between documents to convey the
context or background related to the issue in the correspondence. Understanding the context and
background can be key information for decision makers to understand the issue and make good
decisions.

Arranging and Marking Attachments

Attachment, appendix, annex, and exhibit all mean additional or supplementary material and
indicate relative position within a correspondence package. The first addition to the document is
an attachment; an addition to an attachment is an appendix; an addition to an appendix is an
annex; and additions to an annex are exhibits. Indicate on the attachment, appendix, annex, or
exhibit if there are appendices, annexes, or exhibits to it.

Type or write attachment markings in the same position as on the basic correspondence. Use
pencil to allow renumbering and reuse with other documents. Mark attachments as follows:

- Attachments are marked in the lower right corner as Atch 1, Atch 2, Atch 3, etc.
- Appendices to attachments are marked as Appendix A, Appendix B, Appendix C, etc.
- Annexes to appendices are marked as Annex 1, Annex 2, Annex 3, etc.
- Exhibits to annexes are marked as Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C, etc.
- For multiple-page attachments, number the pages of each attachment in a separate
    sequence. For example Atch 1 (1 of 3), Atch 1 (2 of 3), Atch 1 (3 of 3), etc.
- When sending more than one copy of an attachment, place the copy number (typed or
    handwritten) to the right and slightly above the attachment number to indicate the copy is
    the first, second, third, etc. For example Atch 1^1 , Atch 1^2 , Atch 1^3 , etc.
